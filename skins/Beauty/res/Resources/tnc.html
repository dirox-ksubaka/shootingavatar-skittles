    (&ldquo;the Lucky Draw&rdquo;)</b></u></p>

    <p>By playing this Game (defined below) and taking part in this Contest and Lucky
    Draw you shall be deemed to have accepted and be bound by these terms and conditions
    (&ldquo;<b>Terms &amp; Conditions</b>&rdquo;), as may be amended by Touch Media
    Network Pte. Ltd. (&ldquo;<b>the Organiser</b>&rdquo;) from time to time, as well as
    all prevailing Facebook terms and conditions of use.</p>

    <h3><b>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS:</b></h3>

    <p>The Contest will be integrated in the present &ldquo;<b>playTMN Can
    Shooter</b>&rdquo; game published by the Organiser over its playTMN in-store
    interactive media network (&ldquo;the Game&rdquo;) and is valid in Singapore
    only.</p>

    <p>The Lucky Draw will take place on the Organiser&rsquo;s Facebook page at
    facebook.com/playTMN and is valid in Singapore only.</p>

    <p>Participation in the Contest and in the Lucky Draw are NOT mutually exclusive. You
    may participate in either one, or both.</p>

    <h3><b>ENTRIES &amp; PARTICIPATION</b></h3>

    <p>The Contest and the Lucky Draw will both commence from 05 June 2014, 1000 hours
    (Singapore time) and will end on 30 June 2014, 2359 hours (Singapore time)
    (&ldquo;<b>the Promotion Period</b>&rdquo;). The Contest and the Lucky Draw are open
    to all Singapore citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or over, as at the time of
    submission of a Contest Entry (as defined below) and/or of a Lucky Draw Entry (as
    defined below). Employees of the Organiser, its affiliates, promotion and advertising
    agencies and authorised retailers, together with their immediate family members, are
    not eligible to participate.</p>

    <p>You may enter the Contest by submitting your mobile phone number via the
    designated keypad at the end of the Game (&ldquo;<b>Contest Entry</b>&rdquo;) during
    the Promotion Period. Doing so will register the Score (defined below) you performed
    in the Game immediately before the Contest Entry on the Organiser&rsquo;s information
    systems. You can submit more than one (1) Contest Entry, and the Organiser will only
    retain, among all your successfully-registered Contest Entries, the Contest Entry
    with the lowest Score during the Promotion Period. A Contest Entry will be deemed
    void if the Organiser determines that a Contest Entry is incomplete, irregular,
    altered, counterfeit, produced in error, obtained through fraud or theft, or if the
    mobile phone number provided is not a valid and active Singapore mobile phone number
    operated by M1, Singtel or Starhub.</p>

    <p>You may enter the Lucky Draw by accessing the Organiser&rsquo;s Facebook page at
    facebook.com/playTMN page and pressing the &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button to achieve a
    &ldquo;Liked&rdquo; status (&ldquo;<b>Lucky Draw Entry</b>&rdquo;) during the
    Promotion Period. Doing so will register your Facebook profile on the
    Organiser&rsquo;s information systems. A Lucky Draw Entry will only remain valid so
    long as the &ldquo;Liked&rdquo; status is maintained until the end of the Promotion
    Period. You can only submit one (1) Lucky Draw Entry, and a Lucky Draw Entry will be
    deemed void if the Organiser determines that a Lucky Draw Entry is incomplete,
    irregular, altered, counterfeit, produced in error, obtained through fraud or theft,
    or if the Facebook account associated to the Lucky Draw Entry is not a valid and
    active Facebook account.</p>
